# File Reversal Project

This project demonstrates a file reversal process in Kotlin, using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. It includes classes for reversing content, handling files, and a complete file reversal process.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several Kotlin files and one test files:

- `ContentReverser.kt`: Contains a class for reversing content.
- `FileHandler.kt`: Implements a class for file handling.
- `FileReverser.kt`: Contains a class for the complete file reversal process.
- `Main.kt`: Main entry point for running this application.
- `ContentReverserTest.kt`: Includes tests for the `ContentReverser` class.

## How to Run Tests

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nirav-bhandari/ReverseContent.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd ReverseContent
  ```
3. Run the tests:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew test
  ```
## Usage
To use the file reversal functionality in your own project, you can follow these steps:

Copy the relevant classes (ContentReverser.kt, FileHandler.kt, FileReverser.kt, Main.kt) into your project.

Modify the classes as needed for your specific requirements.

You can run the tests to ensure that the functionality works as expected.
